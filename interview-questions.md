# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is the placeholder for a value to be entered in a function. When that placeholder receives a value, it is known as an argument. For example const midnightSnack = () => {} is the building block code for an arrow function. The parantheses indicate the parameter. If I entered a word in there, like popcorn, I'm creating an argument (popcorn) that I can refer to to produce an output, like in a conditional statement producing "buttered" or "unbuttered" popcorn.

Researched answer: Parameters and arguments are similar, but parameters refer to the function expression by use of parantheses. Arguments are the values that get placed into the parentheses inside the function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The predefined parameters are index, array, and something else.

Researched answer: The predefined parameters are value, index, and array. Value is required, but index and array are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Map and filter differ by the number of output items in an array. Map outputs the same number of items as the original array, whereas filter outputs a subset of the original array.

Researched answer: .map iterates through an array returning a new array of the same length, and . filter iterates through an array returning the values of the condition. It is evaluating for true/false or truthy/falsy values.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the process of moving through indexed items in an array depending on the method being used.

Researched answer: Iteration is occurs anytime time a block of code is executed over and over until a specific condition is met. It is not exclusive to arrays. For example, for loops iterate through a block of code by designating a starting point, end point, and what action to iterate.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: An object is a set of data. An example is an array. There are other types of objects, however, such as the key:value pair type of object. Classes are like recipes to produce objects. They include the building blocks to reproduce many objects without having to repeat extra data input.

Researched answer: A class is a special function that is the template for making objects. An object is a data type used to store keyed collections of data. The data in objects can be static or action based, so they can contain functions. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript? 

Your answer: I don't recall. Something to do with placing data up?

Researched answer: As the name suggests, hoisting refers to processing variable declarations prior to the running of executable code. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: The perspective of looking at software as a user (not developer) and providing feedback in first person as to the desired features and actual effects of the software in use.

2. Spread operator: An operator in JavaScript that permits iterations to occur.

3. React state: A special variable in React that stores data that determines how the component renders and behaves.

4. React props: Specialized React objects that pass data from a parent component to a nested component through component invocation.

5. DOM events: Document Object Model events are user interactions like mouse movement, keyboard typing, or hovering above a button/menu/etc. item.
